(* The focus of this problem is on courses and curricula at DTU. A course is uniquely identified
by a course number and a course is described by a title and a number of ECTS point. The
course base is a map from course numbers to course descriptions. *)

(* We require in this problem that valid ECTS points are positive integers that are divisible
by 5, that is, 5, 10, 15, 20, ... is the sequence of valid ECTS points. *)

(* 1. Declare a function isValidCourseDesc: CourseDesc -> bool,
where isValidCourseDesc desc is true if the ECTS part of desc is valid.*)

base cb is valid, that is, it satisfies the predicate isValidCourseDesc. *)

(* The bachelor programmes are organized according to the flag model, with three course
groups for basic natural science courses, technological core courses and project and profes-
sional skills courses, respectively.
The group of elective courses form the fourth component of the flag model. This group is
described by a predicate on course numbers, characterizing the courses the study leader
has accepted as suitable elective courses. Furthermore, a course plan is given by a set of
courses numbers: *)

type ProjectProfessionalSkill = CourseGroup;; type Elective = CourseNo -> bool;;
type FlagModel = BasicNaturalScience * TechnologicalCore * ProjectProfessionalSkill * Elective;; 
type CoursePlan = Set<CourseNo>;;

(* A flag model (bns,tc,pps,ep) is valid if
• the three course groups bns,tc and pps are all valid,
• no course belongs to more than one of the course groups bns,tc and pps, and
• any course belonging to a course group bns,tc or pps must qualify as an elective
course, that is, it must satisfy the predicate ep.*)

(* 6. Declare a function isValid: FlagModel -> CourseBase -> bool that can test whether
a flag model is valid for a given course base. *)

(* A course plan cs satisfies a (valid) flag model of a bachelor programme (for a given course
base), if the number of ECTS points earned from the courses in cs is 180, subject to the
requirement that 45 points are earned in each course group of the flag model, including
the elective courses.*)

(* 7. Declare a function checkPlan: CoursePlan -> FlagModel -> CourseBase -> bool
that can check whether a course plan satisfies a flag model for a given course base. *)
